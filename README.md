# Non-Transitive Game Theory
### Preamble
This repository initially was used for documenting my work for a final project in college. It was a class in graph theory and combinatorics, and the old code and pdf paper can be found [here](https://github.com/CameronRutherford/Non-Transitive-Game-Theory/tree/master/MA430W). Thank you Nate Moyer for introducing me to this topic, as well as all the various mathematicians I have had the pleasure of learning from so far.
## Introduction
Game theory is a wide ranging topic, and in no way to I intend to try and summarise all of it's various connections to other fields. In this repository, analysis is focused on non-transitive games, and the fairness of various competitive contexts. 
### Non-transitive Games
The simplest example of one of these games is rock, paper, scissors.
### Fairness
Since there are many aspects that go into making a competition fair, this section will provide an explanation of the various angles through which one can consider the topic.
